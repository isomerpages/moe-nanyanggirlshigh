### Art Elective Programme (AEP)


The AEP is a 4-year programme that allows students who have interest, artistic potential and talent to pursue an in-depth study and practice across a wide range of art media and theory. It aims to develop well-rounded and well-informed art talents in a conducive environment that promotes creativity. An emphasis on the integration of art history and studio practice is placed on teaching and learning within the classrooms. Beyond regular lessons, visits to artists’ studios, galleries, museums are also organised to expose students to the experience of art making, viewing and appreciating. Collaborative projects and hands-on activities outside the classrooms are also arranged to broaden the students' authentic experiences as artists.

At the Secondary 3 level, students will participate in the annual Art Elective Global Classroom Programme to Taiwan. Each student will get the opportunity to embark on an experiential journey planned by themselves with close guidance from the teachers. An itinerary comprising of a school exchange programme, workshops with artists and interaction with stakeholders in the art industry will allow students to broaden global perspectives.

Students in the AEP will develop intermediate level skills in both traditional and digital mediums ranging from drawing, painting, to that of illustration and photography. Students will gain literacy in print, design and video software; at the same time be exposed to the use of virtual and augmented reality. They will also learn about the history of both Western and Southeast Asian Art as well as effective critique and articulation of ideas through their individual practice.

AEP students will take a school-based equivalent of Higher Art in place of Food Studies at lower secondary. Graduates from this programme are also strongly encouraged to further their studies in AEP offered by HCI in Years 5-6.

Interested students are welcome to take the AEP selection test when they report to the school in December of each year following the release of the Secondary 1 Posting Results. They will also need to attend a portfolio interview for consideration into the programme.

_There is a second intake for General Art students at the end of Secondary 2, subject to further criteria and selection by the school._



### Higher Music Programme (HMP)


The HMP is a 4-year programme that provides opportunities for musically-inclined students to pursue a deeper and more comprehensive study in the subject. It aims to develop well-rounded and well-informed music talents in a conducive environment that promotes creativity. Beyond regular lessons, the programme also organises concerts for the students, to expose them to authentic performance experiences. Opportunities to perform outside the classrooms and school are also created to broaden the students' experiences as musicians.

Students in the programme will develop skills in music analysis, creating and performing as a soloist as well as in an ensemble setting. They will study a range of musical genres and styles, including Western Art Music, Jazz, Pop and Asian Music.

HMP students will take Advanced Music in place of Food Studies at lower secondary.
