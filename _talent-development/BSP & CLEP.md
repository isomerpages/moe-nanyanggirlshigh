### Bicultural Studies Programme (Chinese)


The Bicultural Studies Programme offered in Nanyang Girls’ High School and Hwa Chong Institution aims to nurture bilingual and bicultural students who are passionate about learning the cultures of the East and the West and are able to navigate across cultures confidently. With an emphasis on global outlook and cosmopolitanism in citizenship education, the two-year programme adopts a variety of approaches such as cross-cultural comparison, historical analyses and experiential learning to cultivate the critical thinking and cultural competencies of students and deepen their understanding of the history, social, economic development and international relations of contemporary China.

Students enrolled in the BSP will have the opportunity to participate in an overseas immersion programme in China, Southeast Asia and the UK or the US, to gain a deeper appreciation of the different cultures and engage with experts in the field. In addition, to develop students’ translation and leadership skills, students are also exposed to a wide range of courses and talent development programmes including Advanced Translation course, Research skills programme, Bilingual Youth Model United Nations Conference, and Member of Parliament attachment programme.



### Chinese Language Elective Programme (CLEP)


The Chinese Language Elective Programme at Secondary Level (CLEP-Sec) is introduced by the Ministry of Education to be implemented from 2020. It aims to nurture promising students to attain a high level of language proficiency in Chinese and enhance their understanding of Chinese literature. The programme also aims to develop these students to become effectively bilingual so as to better serve the needs of our nation.

In this programme, students will be appreciating and analysing long and short novels, ancient and contemporary poetry,  through various approaches such as text analysis, collaborative learning and drama. The 2-year programme aims to nurture Asian Literature advocates, reflective readers, critical learners, global thinkers and inventive creators.

CLEP at NYGH provides a wide range of enrichment programmes and activities to enhance students’ learning and cultivate a deeper interest in Chinese Literature. These activities include the compulsory Sec 3-4 Chinese Literature Appreciation Programme (CLAP), Literary lecture series, camps, overseas immersion trips, publishing of literary works and school-based projects.
