In Nanyang Girls’ High School, the Physical Education department consciously makes use of movement as the primary medium to reach and teach the whole child through the following three modes: 
education in movement; 
education through movement; and 
education about movement.

We also place our students as the centre of our Physical Education syllabus by equipping them with fundamental movement and sports skills in Lower Secondary years that would serve them well in leading active lifestyles. In Upper Secondary, the design of our PE syllabus takes into consideration the changing profiles and lifestyles of our students as they move towards adulthood. As such, sports offered in Upper Secondary (e.g. dance, tennis, table tennis etc) are popular activities in our local context that our students might possibly pursue in the future. In addition, our Upper Secondary students also take ownership in their learning by taking up the sports they are interested in for their elective sports modules. 

With these aims in mind, our PE programme is designed to incorporate the following aspects:
<ul>
	<li>Fundamental movement and sports skills through track and field events and broad-based sports programme focusing on the use of thematic approach of Games Concepts in Lower Secondary;
Team-focused and Interest-driven sport specialisation in Upper Secondary; and 
		Progressive learning of health and fitness principles and outdoor education across the 4 years.</li>
	<li>Outside of their PE lessons, our students experience a variety of events and activities that allow them to enjoy physical activities in both leisure and competitive settings, to bond within and across classes, and to also interact and compete with the parents of Nanyang Girls’ High. Such activities include our sports meet, cross-country runs, staff-student games and inter-class games.</li></ul>
