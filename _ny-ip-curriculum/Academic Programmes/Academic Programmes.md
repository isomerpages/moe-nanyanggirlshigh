Nanyangâ€™s Academic Curriculum is designed to enable students to pursue a course of study based on aptitude, strength, interest, and aspiration. At the lower secondary levels, the curriculum is broad-based, giving students the opportunity to discover their areas of interest before pursuing them at upper secondary and beyond. The curriculum is also grounded in our commitment to providing an enriching bilingual and bicultural experience for all our students.
