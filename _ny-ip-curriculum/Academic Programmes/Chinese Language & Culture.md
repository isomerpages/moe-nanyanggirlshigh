<p>“Every Nanyang girl is a lifelong learner who loves the Chinese language
and culture. She is well-read and refined, and possesses global perspectives.”
This is the vision of Nanyang Girls’ High School Chinese Language and Culture
Department. To achieve this vision, the department is committed to fostering
students' love for the Chinese language and culture, improving their language
proficiency and cultural competencies, instilling right moral values, and
broadening their horizons and perspectives. We hope to develop students
who can communicate effectively in Chinese, become bilingual, bicultural
individuals with a global perspective, and embody 21st-century competencies
and dispositions.</p>
<p>In addition to the Higher Chinese Language and Culture curriculum, the
department also enhances students' language application skills through
various programmes and authentic learning experiences, which allow students
to embrace Mandarin as a living language, thereby fostering their love
for the language and Chinese culture. These programmes include enrichment
and talent development programmes tailored for Secondary 1 to 4 students,
level reading programmes, literature workshops and seminars, learning journeys,
weekly news and current affairs sharing, and many more.</p>

#### Secondary 1 to 4 Higher Chinese Language (HCL) Curriculum

<p>Nanyang Girls’ High School’s HCL curriculum emphasises the practicality
of language learning, with the aim of developing students' language and
thinking skills. It aims to help students acquire communicative competence
in Chinese while sensitizing them to the links between language and culture.</p>
<p>The four-year Higher Chinese Language curriculum is a school-based curriculum
designed using the concept-based curriculum instruction (CBCI) approach,
while adhering to the Ministry of Education's national syllabus and examination
requirements. It follows the principles of gradual progression, beginning
with fundamental linguistic concepts and advancing to more complex levels,
ensuring a continuous and upward learning trajectory. This approach enables
students to steadily improve their language proficiency while mastering
both interdisciplinary and linguistic concepts.</p>
<p>At the heart of our Higher Chinese Language Curriculum is a vision to
cultivate students' proficiency in reading, understanding, analyzing, and
appreciating Chinese literary works. By enhancing their cultural literacy
and deepening their connection to their Chinese heritage, the 4-year course
focuses on developing students into well-rounded individuals with strong
character and a deep sense of national identity.</p>

#### Secondary 1 to 4 Chinese Culture Curriculum

<p>Our Secondary 1 to 4 Chinese Culture Curriculum begins with the engaging
Appreciation of Chinese Culture (ACC) Course for lower secondary students,
designed to ignite their interest in Chinese literature and history. This
foundational course introduces students to literary works, historical narratives,
and cultural activities, fostering an early appreciation of Chinese culture.
As they progress to upper secondary, we offer four distinct levels of cultural
programmes tailored to their individual interests and preferences.</p>
<p>Through this curriculum, we aim to cultivate students who can think from
multiple perspectives, develop critical and creative thinking skills, and
acquire essential 21st-century competencies. We are committed to nurturing
in students a deep appreciation for and dedication to preserving the rich
heritage of Chinese culture.</p>
