In Nanyang Girls’ High School, Integrated Mathematics is offered to all lower secondary students. In upper secondary, students will study Integrated Mathematics 1 and either Integrated Mathematics 2 or Advanced Mathematics. The Mathematics curriculum aims to nurture students into becoming critical thinkers and innovative problem solvers who are able to connect ideas through the applications of Mathematics. They will solve non-routine and complex real-world contextual problems that require deeper insight, logical reasoning and creative thinking.

To make the learning experience meaningful and engaging, the Mathematics Department organises activities to foster students’ interest and to allow them to see the applications and beauty of Mathematics. Students have options to take part in various Mathematics competitions such as The Australian Mathematics Competition, The Singapore Mathematical Olympiad and The Singapore Mathematics Project Festival.
