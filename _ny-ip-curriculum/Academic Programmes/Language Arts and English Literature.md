The English Language Arts classroom seeks to engage our students in sense and meaning-making with authentic literary and non-literary texts relevant to real-world contexts. It promotes active participation and multiple viewpoints, through which the student may discover her own voice and communicate with conviction, style and grace. 

Texts and learning experiences in the Language Arts classroom aim to fulfil not only the intellectual and cognitive demands of school, but also the social-emotional, the moral-ethical, the aesthetic and the physical needs and readiness of our students. The development of metacognitive skills enables the student to monitor her own learning and to gain a greater sense of self-efficacy. In addition, opportunities for collaboration serve to build a learning community that recognises the strength and value of shared knowledge. 

Through Language Arts, all students build a foundation in Literature that will build in them essential 21CC dispositions and skills. Through the study of literary works, students negotiate meaning-making through dialogue, they learn empathy as they seek to understand the feelings of others, consider the human condition through different perspectives and reflect on their own place in the world and their words and actions on others.

### Drama 

This subject is offered to all Secondary Two students. The curriculum is designed to engage and challenge students to maximise their expressive abilities and enjoyment of theatre. By working individually and collaboratively, students will create drama that explores a range of imagined and created situations. They will perform scripted and devised drama using a variety of performance techniques, dramatic forms and conventions to engage an audience; through this process, they will reflect on the meaning and function of drama and theatre in relation to the human experience.

### Philosophical Inquiry 

We believe in exposing students to Philosophy so that they will develop the ability to logically and critically examine assumptions, beliefs and issues. Students will be nurtured through the process of learning of logical principles, critical reading of philosophical texts, as well as rich discussions. 

### Literature Mentorship Programme

Students with a passion for and an aptitude in Literature are mentored in this enrichment programme in their Secondary Two year. Secondary Two students keen to enrol in this programme may sign up to participate in the selection process. 

Selected students are pulled out of some Language Arts lessons to study literature at greater breadth and depth. They will complete readings, writing tasks, discussions and projects.

### Literature 

Students who enjoy Literature may choose to take Literature as a separate subject in Secondary Three and Four. They will study Literature in greater depth and acquire the skills needed in research essay writing. This subject introduces students to the reading, appreciation and analysis of texts in Literature in English through the ages. It includes texts from around the world, from American and European Literature to African and Asian writing in English and translated works. Students keen to read Literature at H2 level in junior college will benefit from a curriculum that prepares them to excel in the subject.
