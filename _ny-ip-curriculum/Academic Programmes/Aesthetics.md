All students experience Aesthetics & Applied Learning through Art, Dance, Food Studies, Maker and Music lessons in the lower secondary levels. These are platforms through which students develop a spirit of experimentation and exploration, confidence in communication, and an awareness of various cultural identities. The provision of arts education in applied settings contributes to the holistic development of each child.

Students who demonstrate a strong interest and inclination towards Art and Music are welcome to apply to join the Art Elective Programme (AEP) or Higher Music Programme (HMP) from Secondary 1 as an additional subject. AEP and HMP are part of the Talent Development Programmes offered at the school. Selection for consideration into these programmes include a selection test and a portfolio interview (for art) and audition (for music).

## Art

The lower secondary art curriculum aims to extend and deepen learning experiences in tandem with the growth of students’ developmental capacities and interests. By providing exposure to artists, movements and various mediums of art, the curriculum cultivates an appreciation for art and facilitates the creation of artworks. Students are encouraged to respond with curiosity, engage in creative thinking, apply prior knowledge to novel contexts and cultivate the capacity to express and communicate their thoughts and inspirations visually. This approach promotes intellectual, emotional and social development; nurturing creativity with an emphasis on critical thinking, artistic expression and imagination through experiential learning.

At the end of Secondary 2, students demonstrating aptitude and passion for the subject may choose to apply to join the Art Elective Programme (AEP) at the upper secondary level, subject to a selection process.

## Music

The lower secondary music curriculum aims to enable students to express themselves confidently through music performance and creation, and develop in them an informed appreciation of a variety of musical cultures and styles. Students develop musical skills and understanding through active musical experiences and involvement in listening, performing, and creating processes individually and in groups. These include music-making in applied contexts such as modules in Songwriting, and Film Music. In the music classrooms, students are encouraged to share their thoughts and ideas, and to be involved in musical decision-making. The discipline develops in students critical thinking skills, social awareness, moral and cultural values, all of which contribute to the holistic development of a child.

At the end of Secondary 2, students demonstrating aptitude and passion for the subject may choose to apply to join the Higher Music Programme (HMP) at the upper secondary level, subject to a selection process.

## Dance

Being a Special Assistance Programme (SAP) School, part of our mission is to preserve Chinese values and traditions. Chinese Dance is hence integrated into the lower secondary Appreciation of Chinese Culture (ACC) programme. Students will be introduced to different Chinese dance styles and techniques, and better appreciate the Chinese culture and dance as a form of identity. The dance curriculum further aims to develop the Nanyang girl to be elegant, graceful, poised and confident. It is a way for self and/or group expression, and serves as a communicable tool between the performer and audience.

## Food Studies

The Food Studies curriculum draws on Singapore’s changing social and economic landscape and technological advancements in food and consumer products. Students will be equipped with knowledge and skills to discern and manage the impact of changing lifestyle and attitudes towards health, environment and financial management on themselves and their community. The subject also develops 21st century competencies in students as they apply the knowledge in nutrition and health, food literacy, consumer literacy and food science to the Singapore context. 

## Maker

The Maker Programme for lower secondary students provides an innovative platform for hands-on learning, integrating the principles of Design Thinking. Through curated lessons and projects, students enjoy the opportunity to explore STEAM (Science, Technology, Art, Engineering, and Mathematics) and creative disciplines while honing 21st Century competencies and skills such as critical thinking, communication, collaboration and resilience. By embracing a design thinking approach during Maker activities, students learn to empathise with end-users, identify needs, brainstorm ideas, prototype solutions and create original products based on feedback. This immersive experience not only develops technical proficiency but also fosters a mindset of innovation and adaptability, preparing students to tackle real-world challenges with confidence.
