The Science Department at Nanyang Girls’ High School aims to instil and nurture students’ passion in Science and develop in them the scientific thinking skills, values and attitudes that are to be applied to their daily lives as a responsible member of the society. To achieve this mission, they implemented a dynamic and challenging curriculum that builds the knowledge, skills and attitudes necessary for students to innovate and pursue STEM for future learning and work. 

To make Science learning coherent and meaningful, the Science curriculum is organised around Core Concepts, which are distilled ideas central to Science. The Core Concepts help students see the coherence and conceptual links within and across the different sub-disciplines of Science (i.e. Biology, Chemistry and Physics). The Core Concepts also provide a framework to make visible students’ progression in Science understanding across the different levels of education. Teachers will be able to pitch their lessons according to the students’ stage of readiness to help them gradually develop understanding of Science concepts with increasing complexity.

To generate awareness in Science, every Nanyang girl will experience enrichment activities such as visits to Science exhibitions and talks on specific areas of Science and Science-related competitions. The school also organises the Science and Maths Festival annually to excite the students in the learning of Science.

At upper secondary, students have the option of deepening their knowledge of Science by offering Chemistry, and Physics or Biology.
