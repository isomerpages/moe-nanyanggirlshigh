The Humanities curriculum in Nanyang Girlsâ€™ High School aims to nurture each student to become a Respected Member of Society and an Agent of Change. Through the study of the various Humanities subjects, such as History, Geography, and Integrated Humanities, students will gain a holistic perspective of Singapore, Southeast Asia, China, and the rest of the world today. They will also acquire skills in critical thinking and research as well as academic writing and presentation. Opportunities to go on field trips relevant to the various subjects will be offered to students as well, in order to further enrich their study of the world.
