In alignment with the "Transforming Education through Technology" Masterplan 2030, our school is dedicated to integrating Information and Communication Technology (ICT) to enhance educational outcomes. Our holistic approach reflects this commitment, where digital literacy and artificial intelligence (AI) literacy are integral components of our teaching and learning ecosystem.

#### Integration of Digital Literacies

We have designed our curriculum to seamlessly incorporate the "Find, Think, Apply, Create" framework and the nine key digital competencies outlined in the Masterplan into every academic subject and student development programme. This ensures that students across all disciplines have the necessary skills to navigate, analyse, and leverage digital resources, enhancing their understanding and engagement with each subject matter.

#### Specialisation in Infocomm Club

Our Infocomm Club offers students opportunities to further develop their digital competencies by learning various coding languages, collaborating on AI-driven problem-solving, and exploring animation and digital art. Additionally, participation in initiatives like Sentinel—a cybersecurity programme by the Ministry of Defence and the Singapore Armed Forces—allows students to engage in cyber-related activities, covering topics such as phishing, social engineering, reverse engineering, and cryptography.

#### Educational Technology

Educational Technology serves as a means to empower student voices and ensure that learning is a student-driven process. Grounded in MOE’s Digital Literacies for Students, our approach ensures that learners develop essential skills to navigate and thrive in a digitally connected world. Our students are encouraged to:

*   Navigate and Search Effectively: Use digital tools to efficiently locate, evaluate, and organise information while discerning credible sources from misinformation.
    
*   Think Critically and Solve Problems: Apply digital skills to analyse situations, develop innovative solutions, and leverage technology for real-world problem-solving.
    
*   Communicate and Collaborate Responsibly: Engage in meaningful digital interactions, leveraging various platforms and media formats to communicate clearly and work effectively with others.
    
*   Create and Innovate with Digital Tools: Use digital technologies to generate original content, develop creative solutions, and express ideas in diverse and impactful ways.
    
*   Practice Ethical and Safe Online Behavior: Understand digital rights, responsibilities, and cyber wellness principles to engage safely, respectfully, and responsibly in online spaces.
    
By aligning with MOE’s Digital Literacies for Students, we ensure that our students develop technological proficiency and the critical thinking and ethical awareness needed to be responsible and capable digital citizens.

#### e-Pedagogy

We have adopted e-pedagogy practices to foster active learning that creates participatory, connected, and reflective classrooms. Our educators are empowered to integrate technology confidently and purposefully, utilising frameworks such as:

*   <b>SAMR Model</b>: Guides the integration of technology to transform learning experiences.
    
*   <b>EdTech Pedagogical Scaffold</b>: Provides key actions for designing and facilitating active learning with technology.
    
*   <b>Active Learning Processes (ALP) &amp; Key Applications of Technology (KATs)</b>: Assist in designing differentiated learning experiences and assessments.
 
Teachers use e-pedagogy principles to:

*   Design learning experiences to meet students’ diverse learning needs
    
*   Deploy key applications of technology to differentiate learning experiences better
    
*   Design a variety of assessment tasks
    
*   Involve students in assessment and get them to reflect on their learning
    
*   Capture student learning and use data to differentiate and personalise learning

#### Cyber Wellness and Digital Citizenship

At Nanyang Girls’ High School, Cyber Wellness goes beyond understanding online safety. We emphasise the development of empowered and empathetic digital citizens capable of navigating online spaces safely and responsibly. Our Cyber Wellness and Digital Citizenship education is integrated into the curriculum through workshops, talks, and activities led by teachers and Technology &amp; Cyber Wellness Ambassadors (TCWAs). These programmes focus on identifying online risks, promoting positive online behaviour, and using technology to contribute positively to the community.

#### AI Literacy: Preparing for a Smart Future

Recognising the transformative potential of AI, we are actively incorporating AI literacy into our curriculum. Students will learn about AI principles, machine learning, and ethical considerations, empowering them to use AI tools responsibly and critically while envisioning and shaping future technologies.

As part of this initiative, the school has begun exploring using Generative AI (Gen AI), specifically Google Gemini for Education, in teaching and learning. This pilot aims to enhance students' digital competencies by allowing them to engage with AI as a tool for research, creative expression, and personalised learning. Through carefully structured learning experiences, students develop an understanding of AI’s capabilities and limitations, ethical implications, and responsible usage in an academic setting.

By integrating AI literacy into the curriculum, we aim to equip students with the skills and critical awareness needed to navigate an AI-driven world, fostering innovation and ethical responsibility in using emerging technologies.
