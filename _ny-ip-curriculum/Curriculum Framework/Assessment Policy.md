Assessment in NYGH is integral to all teaching and learning. Assessment exists primarily to support and encourage student learning by enabling both teachers and students to gather and analyse the extent to which desired knowledge, understanding, skills and attitudes are effectively taught, learnt and demonstrated. This is done through two broad categories of assessment: Formative Assessment and Summative Assessment.

Assessment in NYGH seeks to:
* Monitor the progress of student learning and development
* Provide coherent and timely feedback for students, parents and stakeholders to assist students in their learning
* Evaluate studentsâ€™ outcomes objectively against the intended outcomes of the programme or syllabus
* Provide teachers with data and evidence relevant in evaluating the effectiveness of their teaching and/or programmes
* Enable students to demonstrate what they know and can do
* Clarify student understanding of concepts and promote deeper understanding
* Provide evidence that current understanding and skills are a suitable basis for future learning.

In NYGH, we believe that learning is an on-going process and formative assessments of multiple modes provide both students and teachers with checkpoints at different times for continuous improvement. Summative Assessments, on the other hand, are helpful for making placement decisions.
