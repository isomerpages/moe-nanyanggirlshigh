### Science Talent Development Programme 

High ability students with a passion in Science will be developed and groomed through programmes and enrichment activities such as the Innovation Programme (IvP), Greenwave Envirocare Projects (Greenwave), Science Mentorship Programme (SMP), Student Inquiry Assignments, and other Science research projects. Admission to these programmes is subject to recommendations by the Science teachers. Students will have opportunities to present their work at various external platforms. Those with strong passion and aptitude in the Sciences may apply to study Advanced Science courses at the upper secondary levels where they will learn an expanded curriculum, engage in the learning of science through real-world connections, and work on independent and authentic learning tasks. This will lay a strong foundation for students who are interested in pursuing a future course of study in Science.

Our top Science students are provided with opportunities to further develop their interest in Science research. They may apply for the Nanyang Science Mentorship Programme (NSMP), Research@DSO and Research@YDSP culminating in the Singapore Science and Engineering Fair. The students may also participate in other high-level Science-related competitions and short-term attachments to research institutions. Students who have attained commendable achievements will be recommended for national Science awards, such as the A*STAR JC Award, the DSTA Scholarship and the Lee Kuan Yew Award for Mathematics and Science.

### Maths Olympiad Training
 
This training is generally targeted for students who are in the top 10-12% for Mathematics. Besides preparing the students for competitions, this course also allows the students to explore various mathematical thinking strategies and problem-solving skills

### Mathematics Research Project 

This programme is open to selected students based on aptitude and interest. Under the guidance of a teacher mentor, students collaborate in a group on a topic of their choice. The process spans over a semester and outstanding projects are selected to participate in the Singapore Mathematics Project Festival organised by the Singapore Mathematical Society. This research mentorship programme is a rigorous one and aims to inspire students to further pursue research in Mathematics beyond the classroom setting.

### Advanced Mathematics â€“ Pre-Calculus with Trigonometry Course 
The Advanced Mathematics course is a customised course adapted from the Honors Pre-calculus with Trigonometry online course from Stanford University Online High School. This course aims to provide content acceleration opportunities for students with a strong aptitude in Mathematics. It is open to selected students at the Secondary Three and Four level.

### Science and Mathematics Talent Programme (SMTP) 
The NYGH Science and Mathematics Talent Programme (SMTP) was introduced with the aim to provide students with outstanding talents in Science and Mathematics an enriching curriculum in terms of breadth and depth. This is a two-year programme that takes the students from Secondary Three to Four and is helmed by both the Math and Science Departments. Students in this programme are strongly encouraged to continue with SMTP offered by HCI.
