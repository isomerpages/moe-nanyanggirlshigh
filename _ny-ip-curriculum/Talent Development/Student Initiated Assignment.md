The NYGH Student Initiated Assignment (SIA) programme is a structured initiative designed to equip Secondary Three students with the essential research skills they need to thrive in their academic journey and beyond. It fosters students' ability to independently identify research questions across disciplines, delve into topics that pique their curiosity, and manage their research process effectively. Through the core curriculum, students gain exposure to diverse research methodologies across different disciplines. This empowers them to tailor their research approach to fit the specific subject matter at hand. The SIA programme fosters collaborative learning, allowing students to work effectively in teams, share ideas, and learn from one another. They also allow students to hone their communication skills by developing clear, concise and well-structured reports and presentations, both written and oral. This structured research experience serves as a valuable stepping stone for students as they embark on their Project Work (PW) at the 'A' Levels.
