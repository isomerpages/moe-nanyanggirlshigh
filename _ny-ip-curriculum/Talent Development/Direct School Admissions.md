<p>Introduced in 2004, the DSA scheme provides students with the opportunity
to seek admission to Nanyang Girls’ High School (NYGH), based on a diverse
range of academic and non-academic achievements and talents that they can
demonstrate beyond the PSLE.</p>
<p>Primary 6 students who wish to seek admission to NYGH based on their achievements
and talents can consider applying through DSA. Otherwise, students will
take part in the Secondary 1 Posting Exercise, whereby admission is based
on their PSLE results.</p>
<p>Parents and students are encouraged to choose schools wisely based on
the student’s aptitude and strengths, bearing in mind NYGH’s academic and
non-academic requirements, and the programmes available to develop the
area of talent.</p>
