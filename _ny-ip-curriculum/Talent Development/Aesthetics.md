### Art Elective Programme (AEP)

The Art Elective Programme (AEP) was first introduced in 1984 as a 4-year programme designed for artistically-inclined students. The AEP curriculum aims to develop students as practitioners, scholars, advocates and leaders in art.

Nanyang Girls’ High School (NYGH) was one of the two secondary schools in Singapore to first offer AEP since 1984. The AEP allows students who have an interest and potential in art to pursue an in-depth study and practice across a wide range of art media. The AEP curriculum at NYGH offers a deep and holistic exploration of art practice and theory. Through engaging modules enriched with technology, students are exposed to a diverse range of art forms and media. Additionally, authentic experiences are facilitated through interactions with artists and industry partners, learning journeys, and collaborative projects that go beyond the confines of the classroom.

### Higher Music Programme (HMP)

Nanyang Girls’ High School (NYGH) first offered Music as an examinable subject in 2000 and this evolved into a four-year Higher Music Programme (2002) that paves a structured path for talent development in Music.

NYGH Higher Music Programme (HMP) aims to provide musically inclined students the opportunity to deepen their knowledge in music and hone their abilities in listening, creating, performing and research. Aligned to the content and teaching approaches of the O-Level Music Syllabus and taking reference from the MOE Music Elective Programme, the NYGH HMP provides opportunities for students with an aptitude and interest in the subject to pursue the study of music with depth, breadth, and rigour. Through HMP, we hope to grow musical and creative capabilities in students, enable them to appreciate the role of music in human societies and empower girls to apply music to benefit the community.
