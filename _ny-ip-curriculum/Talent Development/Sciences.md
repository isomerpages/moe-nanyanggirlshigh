### Science Talent Development Framework

The Science talent development framework works alongside with the curriculum to infuse passion into the learning of Science in our students and develop students in Science according to their interest and aptitude. Its aim is to nurture a strong passion for research in Science and Technology. Under this framework, a range of research programmes are offered to identified students, which include the Young Defence Scientist Programme, Science Mentorship Programme, Nanyang Research Programme and Innovation Programme. Lessons on research methodology are conducted for all students doing research projects.

### Science and Mathematics Talent Programme (SMTP)

The NYGH Science and Mathematics Talent Programme (SMTP) was introduced  with the aim to provide students with outstanding talents in Science and Mathematics an enriched curriculum in terms of breadth and depth of coverage.  This is a two-year programme that takes the students from Sec 3 to Sec 4, and is helmed by two departments - the Mathematics and Science departments.  
Students in this programme are strongly encouraged to continue with SMTP offered by HCI.
