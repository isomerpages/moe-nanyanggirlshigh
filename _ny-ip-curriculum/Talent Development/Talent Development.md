Our Talent Development Programme seeks to instil the joy of learning as students discover their interests and strengths through diverse learning experiences within the school curriculum. Every student is encouraged to take ownership of her TD journey as she grows in experience and aptitude. 

We believe that every Nanyang Girl is empowered to discover and develop her talents, and will flourish when learning experiences are enjoyable and challenging. 

Our programme aims to design learning experiences for students to discover interests in different domains, provide enrichment programmes for students to develop strengths, and create opportunities for students to shine by helping others learn and grow.
