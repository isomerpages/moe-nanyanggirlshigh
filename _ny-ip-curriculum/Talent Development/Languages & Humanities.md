## Bicultural Studies Programme (BSP)

The Bicultural Studies Programme offered in Nanyang Girls’ High School aims to nurture bilingual and bicultural students who are passionate about learning the cultures of the East and the West and are able to navigate across cultures confidently. With an emphasis on a global outlook and cosmopolitanism in citizenship education, the two-year programme adopts a variety of approaches such as cross-cultural comparison, historical analyses, and model united nations debate, to cultivate critical thinking and cultural competencies and deepen the students’ understanding of the history, social, economic development and international relations of contemporary China. Students enrolled in the BSP will have the opportunity to participate in an overseas immersion programme in China, Southeast Asia, the UK, or the US, to gain a deeper appreciation of the different cultures and engage with experts in the field. In addition, to develop students’ 21st century competencies skills, they are also given the opportunities to lead projects and participate in a wide variety of talent development programmes such as Research Skills Programme, learning journeys and industrial visits, Bilingual Youth Model United Nations Conference, and the Member of Parliament Attachment Programme.

## Chinese Language Elective Programme (CLEP)

The Chinese Language Elective Programme at Secondary Level (CLEP-Sec) was introduced by the Ministry of Education for implementation from 2020. It aims to nurture promising students to attain a high level of language proficiency in Chinese, and to enhance their understanding of Chinese literature. The programme also aims to develop these students to become effectively bilingual so as to better serve the needs of our nation. 

In this programme, students appreciate and analyse long and short novels as well as ancient and contemporary poetry through various approaches such as textual analysis, collaborative learning, and drama. The two-year programme aims to nurture Asian Literature advocates, reflective readers, critical learners, global thinkers, and inventive creators. CLEP at NYGH provides a wide range of enrichment programmes and activities to enhance students’ learning and cultivate a deeper interest in Chinese Literature. These activities include the compulsory Secondary Three and Four Chinese Literature Appreciation Programme (CLAP), Literary Lecture Series, camps, overseas immersion trips, publication of literary works, as well as school-based projects.

## Humanities Programme (HP)

The NYGH Humanities Programme (HP) was introduced with the aim to provide students with outstanding talents in the Humanities an enriched curriculum in terms of breadth and depth of coverage.  
This is a two-year programme that takes the students from Sec 3 to Sec 4, and is helmed by two departments - the Humanities and English Departments.

Students in this programme go through an enriched and differentiated curriculum for Humanities. They have to take Advanced Literature (HP). (All students in NYGH learn Literature as part of Language Arts, but at Upper Secondary levels, students can opt for “Literature” as a separate, “pure” humanities subject if they are interested in pursuing H2 Literature in JC. All HP students are expected to take Advanced Literature (HP), which covers English Literature in even greater depth.) In addition, HP students have a choice of taking Advanced Geography or Advanced History. (Non-HP students are only offered Geography or History.) 

Philosophical Inquiry is also part of the HP curriculum.

Students in this programme are strongly encouraged to continue with HP offered in HCI and many are awarded the Humanities Scholarship offered by the Ministry of Education.

<li>Humanities and Social Sciences Research Programme (HSSRP)  (By selection only – NUS/NTU)</li>
