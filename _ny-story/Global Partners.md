Nanyang Girls’ High School is a renowned school of global standing.

A Nanyang girl not only enjoys the rich traditions of the school and its forward looking curriculum but also the exposure and opportunities that our school offers as a result of our strong partnership with fellow educators, high schools, universities, community service organizations and industrial partners both in Singapore and overseas.

Besides our very established Global Classroom Programme (GCP), our school also works with our global partners on a myriad of programmes and events, including seminars for staff and students, sharing of good practices, industrial attachments, international conferences and our very own Career Conference and Special Interest Lectures.

We have very supportive partners who have continually worked closely with us on long-term immersion programmes, school visits, industrial visits/attachments and benchmarking.

With our deep and strong local and foreign engagements, Nanyang Girls’ High School is a world class institution that is at the forefront of education, fully equipping our girls with the essential 21st century competencies.
