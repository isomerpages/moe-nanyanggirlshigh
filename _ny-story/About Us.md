<p>Nanyang Girls’ High School (NYGH) was founded in 1917.&nbsp;It is a premier independent and Special Assistance Plan (SAP) school with an intake of over 1500 girls ranging from Sec 1 to Sec 4.

Given its vibrant history and rich tradition in bicultural education, NYGH prides itself in providing an all-round holistic education, allowing all girls to thrive in the globalised world of the 21st century.

While academic distinction continues to be the hallmark of Nanyang girls, the vision of NYGH is to nurture every student to be a respected member of society. A Nanyang girl is globally attuned while strongly grounded in her history and traditions. As she navigates through the world in her quest for excellence, the Nanyang girl is guided by strong values embodied in the school motto: “勤 慎 端 朴 - Diligence, Prudence, Respectability, Simplicity”. The belief in contributing back to society undoubtedly stems from the school heritage, which is rich in the legacy of the vision and sacrifices of its pioneers.</p>

The diamond-shaped crest was superimposed on top of a yellow ring emblem on which was printed the words 'Nanyang Girls' High'. This ring emblem rested on top of a yellow banner on which the school motto, in Chinese, was printed. When translated, the school motto reads 'Diligence', 'Prudence', 'Respectability' and 'Simplicity'.</td>
