		<p>If we look back at our historical records, interviews and related characters, without any doubt, Nanyang Girls’ High School was set up by a group of leaders from the United League of China (中国同盟会). These members comprised mostly of young and rich businessmen or intellectuals. With passion and patriotism, they initiated movements to change the fate of the country and these movements changed society.</p>

			<p>The first school principal of Nanyang Girls’ School was Mdm Yu Pei Gao. She graduated from Beijing Normal University (as it is known now) in 1911. Mdm. Yu firmly believed that a batch of good teachers was needed to set up a good school. She abandoned the tradition of forbidding male teachers in a girls’ school and hired male teachers.</p><br>

<p>	Mdm Liew Yuen Sien was born in the Jiangxi Province in China. She was the only child of a rich family and a very independent lady with the determination and courage to pave a career on her own. After graduation from Hunan Changsha Fu Xiang Middle School (长沙福湘中 学), she taught at Xiang Tan San Yu School (湘潭三育学校). Thereafter, she departed for Beijing and studied at Yanjing University(燕京大学).</p>
<p>Mdm Liew was a staunch supporter of women’s rights and freedom and matrimonial freedom. She felt that raising the level of education women received was important. These factors led her to establish Singapore Nanyang Girls’ School as a premier school in Singapore.</p>
<p>In order to realise the school’s aim of providing girls with an equal opportunity for education across South East Asia and China, Mdm Liew would try her best to provide them with funding to continue with their schooling. The Nanyang family spirit was fostered in the background of these expectations. It was therefore no surprise that many alumni of the school remained loyal and often contributed to the school’s cause in education. Mdm. Liew would also often proudly proclaim: we are the top girls’ school in Singapore and Malaya.</p>
