From 2021 onwards, all students in Nanyang Girls’ High School will complete a four-year curriculum in&nbsp;**ICT, Data and Computer Science Curriculum**, to empower our graduates in riding the wave of Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) in transforming society and building knowledge.

After completing core modules in Google Workspace collaboration tools, Data Analysis using EXCEL, Data Visualisation using&nbsp;[TABLEAU](https://www.tableau.com/), and Computer Programming using&nbsp;[PYTHON](https://www.python.org/), students will have the baseline&nbsp;**computational thinking**&nbsp;experiences to engage in research projects in Upper Secondary, higher education and future careers. For example:

*   Analysing corpus of text to derive patterns in word usage over historical periods and current social media platforms
*   Narrating data stories about geographical and historical trends across societies
*   Modelling scientific and mathematical phenomena and systems across interacting agents with complexity and feedback
*   Integrating design thinking in prototyping creative solutions for communities and futures

With the implementation of full Home-Based Learning (HBL) during the COVID-19 Circuit Breaker, Blended Learning will become a regular feature of school life. Nanyang Girls’ High School has been selected by MOE for Phase 1 of the nationwide&nbsp;**Personalised Digital Learning Programme (PDLP)**. From March 2021 onwards, students in all four levels will own a learning device to empower self-directed and collaborative learning anytime, anywhere.

**Educational Technology**

Educational Technology, or EdTech, is the practice of facilitating teaching and learning by creating, using and managing appropriate technological processes and resources.

In Nanyang Girls’ High School, EdTech is a means to empower student voice and ensure that learning is a student-driven process. Modelled after the&nbsp;**International Society for Technology in Education (ISTE) Standards for Students**, students engage in the roles of&nbsp;**Knowledge Constructors**,&nbsp;**Innovative Designers**,&nbsp;**Creative Communicators**&nbsp;and&nbsp;**Global Collaborators**&nbsp;in effectively harnessing technology in their learning. They:

*   critically curate a variety of resources using digital tools to construct knowledge, produce creative artefacts and make meaningful learning experiences for themselves and others
*   use a variety of technologies within a design process to identify and solve problems by creating new, useful or imaginative solutions
*   communicate clearly and express themselves creatively for a variety of purposes using the platforms, tools, styles, formats and digital media appropriate to their goals
*   use digital tools to broaden their perspectives and enrich their learning by collaborating with others and working effectively in teams

**e-Pedagogy**

e-Pedagogy is the practice of teaching with technology for active learning that creates a participatory, connected and reflective classroom to nurture the future-ready learner. Guided by e-Pedagogy, teachers will design learning experiences that enhance student engagement, subject mastery and help students acquire and practise 21st&nbsp;Century Competencies.

Teachers use e-Pedagogy principles to:

*   Design learning experiences to meet students’ diverse learning needs
*   Deploy key applications of technology to better differentiate learning experiences
*   Design a variety of assessment tasks
*   Involve students in assessment and get them to reflect on their own learning
*   Capture student learning and use data to differentiate and personalise learning

**Cyberwellness and Digital Citizenship**

In Nanyang Girls’ High School, Cyberwellness is about much more than merely online safety, or a long list of don’ts. It is also about the dos that help create empowered and empathetic digital citizens who can deal with important issues at the confluence of classroom learning, technology and society.

These dos include:

*   Identifying possible online risks
*   Analysing, evaluating and reflecting on online situations
*   Taking actions to keep safe and be a positive online influence
*   Using technology to make the community better

Cyberwellness and Digital Citizenship education is usually conducted during curriculum time and through programmes such as workshops, talks and activities. These are led by teachers and Technology &amp; Cyberwellness Ambassadors, who are peer-elected class student leaders.
