The ICT curriculum in Nanyang Girls' High School is designed to equip our students with essential digital competencies necessary in the 21st century. Aligned with MOE’s EdTech Masterplan 2030, we integrate these digital competencies under the "Find, Think, Apply, Create" framework across our Total Curriculum.

  
Secondary One students will have a solid foundation in Applied Digital Skills and Cyber Wellness built into their day-to-day school life. In Secondary Two, the compulsory module, "Computational Thinking and Basic Coding in Python", goes beyond coding, fostering problem-solving and logical reasoning in students. These programmes pave the way for further exploration in the Upper Secondary years, during which students can opt for elective modules on Intermediate and Advanced Coding in Python, as well as Introduction to AI and Machine Learning. This tiered approach ensures a progressive and comprehensive learning journey in digital literacy.

  
We believe in providing a holistic education that imparts technical skills and nurtures creativity, critical thinking, and responsible digital citizenship. Our students will grow into not just proficient users of technology but adept innovators and ethical contributors to the digital society.

With the implementation of full Home-Based Learning (HBL) during the COVID-19 Circuit Breaker, Blended Learning will become a regular feature of school life. Nanyang Girls’ High School has been selected by MOE for Phase 1 of the nationwide&nbsp;**Personalised Digital Learning Programme (PDLP)**. From March 2021 onwards, students in all four levels will own a learning device to empower self-directed and collaborative learning anytime, anywhere.

**Educational Technology**

Educational Technology, or EdTech, is the practice of facilitating teaching and learning by creating, using and managing appropriate technological processes and resources.

In Nanyang Girls’ High School, EdTech is a means to empower student voices and ensure that learning is a student-driven process. Modelled after the&nbsp;**International Society for Technology in Education (ISTE) Standards for Students**, students engage in the roles of&nbsp;**Knowledge Constructors**,&nbsp;**Innovative Designers**,&nbsp;**Creative Communicators**&nbsp;and&nbsp;**Global Collaborators**&nbsp;in effectively harnessing technology in their learning. They:

* critically curate a variety of resources using digital tools to construct knowledge, produce creative artefacts and make meaningful learning experiences for themselves and others
* use a variety of technologies within a design process to identify and solve problems by creating new, useful or imaginative solutions
* communicate clearly and express themselves creatively for a variety of purposes using the platforms, tools, styles, formats and digital media appropriate to their goals
* use digital tools to broaden their perspectives and enrich their learning by collaborating with others and working effectively in teams

**e-Pedagogy**

e-Pedagogy is the practice of teaching with technology for active learning that creates a participatory, connected and reflective classroom to nurture the future-ready learner. Guided by e-Pedagogy, teachers will design learning experiences that enhance student engagement, subject mastery and help students acquire and practise 21st&nbsp;Century Competencies.

Teachers use e-Pedagogy principles to:

*   Design learning experiences to meet students’ diverse learning needs
*   Deploy key applications of technology to better differentiate learning experiences
*   Design a variety of assessment tasks
*   Involve students in assessment and get them to reflect on their own learning
*   Capture student learning and use data to differentiate and personalise learning

**Cyberwellness and Digital Citizenship**

In Nanyang Girls’ High School, Cyberwellness is about much more than merely online safety, or a long list of don’ts. It is also about the dos that help create empowered and empathetic digital citizens who can deal with important issues at the confluence of classroom learning, technology and society.

These dos include:

*   Identifying possible online risks
*   Analysing, evaluating and reflecting on online situations
*   Taking actions to keep safe and be a positive online influence
*   Using technology to make the community better

Cyberwellness and Digital Citizenship education is usually conducted during curriculum time and through programmes such as workshops, talks and activities. These are led by teachers and Technology &amp; Cyberwellness Ambassadors, who are peer-elected class student leaders.
