## “LEARNING TO SERVE AND LEAD” FRAMEWORK


The following guiding principles are applied in the design of the Character and Leadership Development curriculum:

*   Student-Centric and Values-Driven
*   Balanced Representation of Character and Citizenship
*   Expanding Domains from Self to World
*   Students’ Life Experiences as Possible Contexts

The philosophy of Servant Leadership and the Be-Do-Have model are also adopted in framing Character and Leadership Development in NYGH.

The Be-Do-Have model will serve to guide our students in their development: to first be a person of character and be confident, to have the resilience to do the right things, following which we can then have the things we want in our service to the nation and the world.

The essence of Character and Leadership Development is captured in the framework with the use of a spiral to illustrate the expanding domains from self to world, and to also illustrate the spiral progression approach taken by the school in the development of the students, for example in the use of the Be-Do-Have model, the Community Education Programme, the Guidance Modules and the tiered levels of Student Leadership Development.

## CHARACTER AND CITIZENSHIP EDUCATION


The aim of Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) is to nurture values and life skills for character and citizenship through powerful experiences and effective facilitation.

The CCE structure is thematic and developmental based on the following components:
