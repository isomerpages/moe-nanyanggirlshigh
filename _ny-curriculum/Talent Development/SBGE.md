The NYGH School-Based Gifted Education (SBGE) aims to provide instruction and enrichment that appropriately challenge and support these students. We aim to develop intellectual rigour, humanity and creativity in the youths and prepare them for responsible leadership and service to country and society.

The NYGH SBGE curriculum and out-of-class activities are differentiated in terms of content, process, product and learning environment, catering to the students’ learning needs and style. There are also differentiated tasks and product expectations.

The NYGH SBGE places great emphasis on self-awareness, social awareness and involvement in the community. Affective education is taught not only during Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) and well-being lessons but infused in all the enriched subjects as well. In addition to CCE, the differentiated goals of Affective Education in the SBGE take into account the characteristics of the gifted.

According to Morelock (1992), Giftedness is asynchronous development in which advanced cognitive abilities and heightened intensity combine to create inner experiences and awareness that are qualitatively different from the norm. This asynchrony increases with higher intellectual capacity. The combination of asynchronous development, advanced cognitive abilities and heightened intensity creates an emotional intensity and strong sensitivity in gifted students not commonly experienced by their peers in the mainstream. Hence, the differentiated goals of the AE curriculum in the SBGE are for students to develop sound moral values through a process of reflection and search for meaning and fulfillment.

To further develop thinking skills and creativity, the school also offers a range of programmes such as research, customized enrichment talks and mentorship for our students.
