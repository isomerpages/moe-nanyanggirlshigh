### TALENT DEVELOPMENT (TD)


Our Talent Development Programme seeks to instill Joy of Learning as students discover their interests and strengths through diverse learning experiences within the school curriculum. Every student is encouraged to take ownership of her TD journey as she grows in experience and aptitude.&nbsp;

We believe that every Nanyang Girl is empowered to discover and develop her talents, and will flourish when learning experiences are enjoyable and challenging.

Talent Development (TD) at Nanyang aims to:

*   design learning experiences for students to&nbsp;**discover**&nbsp;interests in different domains;
*   provide enrichment programmes for students to&nbsp;**develop**&nbsp;strengths; and
*   create opportunities for students to&nbsp;**shine**&nbsp;by helping others learn and grow.

Ultimately, the TD programme aspires to nurture every Nanyang Girl to become&nbsp;_a Respected Member of Society and an Agent of Change_, by making a positive impact in the community and nation at large.
