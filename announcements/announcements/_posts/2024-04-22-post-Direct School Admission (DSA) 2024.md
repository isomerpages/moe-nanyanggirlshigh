<h4><strong>1. Introduction</strong></h4>
<p>Introduced in 2004, the DSA scheme provides students with the opportunity to seek admission to Nanyang Girls’ High School (NYGH), based on a diverse range of academic and non-academic achievements and talents that they can demonstrate beyond the PSLE. </p>
<p>Primary 6 students who wish to seek admission to NYGH based on their achievements and talents can consider applying through DSA. Otherwise, students will take part in the Secondary 1 Posting Exercise, whereby admission is based on their PSLE results.</p>
<p>Students who have been successfully allocated to NYGH via DSA will NOT be allowed to participate in the Secondary 1 Posting Exercise to opt for other secondary schools as places have already been reserved for them in NYGH. They will also NOT be allowed to transfer to another school after the release of the PSLE results. NYGH runs the six-year Integrated Programme in partnership with HCI. They are expected to honour the commitment to NYGH from Year 1 to 4 and to Hwa Chong Institution (HCI) from Year 5 to 6.</p>
<p>Students admitted to NYGH via DSA-CCA are expected to honour the commitment in the CCA from Year 1 to 4. They are allowed to choose another CCA in Year 5 to 6 if they are interested in a new CCA.</p>
<p>Students admitted to NYGH via DSA (Bilingualism, Mathematics, Science, Innovation or Service Leadership) are expected to honour their commitment to participate in the respective domain's programmes from Year 1 to 4 and prioritise these programmes over others.</p>
<p><strong>Parents and students are encouraged to choose schools wisely based on the student’s aptitude and strengths, bearing in mind NYGH’s academic and non-academic requirements, and the programmes available to develop the area of talent.</strong></p>

<h4><strong>8. Frequently Asked Questions</strong></h4>
<p><strong>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What was the admission cut-off point for 2024 Secondary 1&nbsp;students (annual posting exercise)?</strong>
</p>
<p>For 2024 Secondary 1 admission, the cut-off was AL 7(D).</p>
<p><strong>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How many Secondary 1&nbsp;students&nbsp;will be accepted in 2025?</strong>&nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The projected number is 390.</p>
<p><strong>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is&nbsp;the NYGH-HCI Integrated Programme (IP)?</strong>
</p>
<p>NYGH runs the six-year Integrated Programme in partnership with Hwa Chong
Institution (HCI). The IP is a six-year enriched curriculum that equips
students with the necessary knowledge and skills to proceed directly to
the A-Level programme in HCI. Students who have been successfully allocated
to NYGH via DSA are expected to honour the commitment to NYGH from Year
1 to 4 and to HCI from Year 5 to 6.</p>
<p><strong>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does the school offer the Art Elective Programme (AEP) and the Music Elective Programme (MEP)?</strong>
</p>
<p>NYGH offers the AEP. It is a four-year programme and students&nbsp;in
the programme enjoy a fee subsidy as AEP is an MOE-initiated programme.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Though our school is not an MEP centre, we offer our own four-year
Higher Music Programme (HMP) which is modelled after the MEP. However,&nbsp;<em>students&nbsp;in our HMP&nbsp;<u>do not</u>&nbsp;enjoy a fee subsidy</em>&nbsp;unless
they are on ESIS.</p>
<p><strong>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What would the learning experience be like for students who enrol through DSA (Bilingualism,&nbsp;Mathematics, Science, Innovation or Service Leadership)?</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>DSA-Bilingualism</strong>
</p>
<p>To nurture the DSA (Bilingualism) students to be effectively bilingual
and bicultural, the school offers programmes beyond the classroom. The
Lower Secondary students will attend fortnightly NY Enrich lessons to further
develop their communication skills as well as appreciation for culture
and literature.</p>
<p>At upper secondary, it is mandatory for DSA (Bilingualism) students to
read Literature in Chinese as part of the Chinese Language Elective Programme
(CLEP). They will participate in CLEP either as an MOE scholar or non-scholar.
For students who have broader interests, they can choose to additionally
opt for the Humanities Programme (HP) or Bicultural Studies Programme (BSP).
Students are selected into these two programmes based on their passion
and aptitude.</p>
<p><strong>DSA-Mathematics</strong>
</p>
<p>The Mathematics Talent Development Programme for students who are admitted
to our school via DSA-Mathematics offers an invigorating learning experience.&nbsp;
Students will develop their passion, sharpen their problem solving skills
and deepen their learning of Mathematics through a comprehensive four-year
Olympiad training programme.&nbsp; They are given opportunities to take
part in local and international Mathematics competitions. At upper secondary
level, students are encouraged to participate in various research programmes
such as Math Research Project where they will get to explore different
areas of mathematical inquiry.&nbsp; These research projects deepen their
knowledge and hone their critical thinking skills. They are also encouraged
to apply for a study in Advanced Mathematics which is adapted from the
Pre-Calculus with Trigonometry course by Stanford University Online High
School.</p>
<p><strong>DSA-Science</strong>
</p>
<p>Students admitted to our school via DSA-Science are provided with a myriad
of opportunities to hone their skills in research and enrich their learning
in the various scientific disciplines beyond the core curriculum.&nbsp;
They will get to learn from experts in external organisations and institutes
of higher learning. In lower secondary level, students are expected to
participate in at least one research and innovation project such as the
Green Wave Environmental Care Competition or Innovation Programme. At upper
secondary level, students are given various platforms to sharpen their
skills of inquiry.&nbsp; They are expected to challenge themselves by taking
up at least one advanced science course. They will learn to read scientific
journals and carry out independent learning tasks. They are encouraged
to participate in various science competitions and mentorship programmes.
They will get to deepen their research skills through short-term attachment
to research institutions such as DSTA and DSO.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>DSA-Innovation</strong>
</p>
<p>The Innovation Direct School Admission (DSA) Programme seeks to develop
students’ design mindsets and behaviours, which includes developing their
capacity to come up with human-centric solutions or innovate systems and
experiences. Various platforms will be created such as school-based opportunities
for our Innovation DSA students to further develop ideas and early versions
of prototypes. There will also be an active curation of external partnerships
for our students to learn from institutes of higher learning, local start-ups
and other community partners.</p>
<p>Students could consider deepening their interest through programmes and
projects in areas such as Data Science, Maker, Aesthetics or others which
they are keen on. Extended learning opportunities would be facilitated
for our students to observe how innovative design mindsets and behaviours
play out in authentic settings that cut across different industries.</p>
<p><strong>DSA-Service Leadership</strong>
</p>
<p>The Service Leadership Direct School Admission (DSA) Programme seeks to
nurture leaders who place service at the heart of leadership. Students
will be provided with varied authentic learning experiences to develop
their 21st century competencies and leadership qualities. The training
sessions will cover concepts of leadership and give the students opportunities
to work in teams with like-minded students to identify needs in their community
and devise solutions to meet those needs. Mentoring will be provided to
develop the leadership potential of the students.</p>
