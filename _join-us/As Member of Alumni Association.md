Established in 1917, Nanyang Girls’ High School has an illustrious family of alumni who are based both in and outside Singapore.

Our alumni have continually shown strong support to the school by enriching our girls’ experiences in co-curricular activities (CCAs) and sabbatical activities, connecting us with prominent education and industrial partners, hosting our girls when they go on overseas learning journeys or simply by encouraging their daughters to join our school.

Regardless of where our alumni are located, we want to create a comfortable platform where all our old girls can remain connected with their alma mater and friends.

To reach out to all our alumni, we welcome all to join the [NANYANG SCHOOLS ALUMNI ASSOCIATION](http://nanyang.org.sg/).
