Secondary 2 students, who are presently studying in local mainstream Secondary schools. Students who are admitted to their current school via DSA-Sec or AEIS exercise are not eligible for school transfer.&nbsp;_Students from IP schools are strongly discouraged to apply as it could disrupt the quality of the student’s educational experience._

This group of students may either participate in the Ministry of Education’s (MOE) School Placement Exercise for Returning Singaporean (SPERS) or/and our School’s Entrance Examination.
