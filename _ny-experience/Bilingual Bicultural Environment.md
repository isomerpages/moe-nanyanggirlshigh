As an established SAP school, we take pride in providing all our students a conducive bilingual bicultural environment.

In our school, students are given a strong foundation for understanding the East and the West and achieving mastery in both the English and the Chinese languages.

Our students may or may not have taken Higher Chinese in Primary School. With a passion for language and the right attitude for learning, our students are well guided in their bilingual bicultural journey as learners. Â At the end of their secondary school life with us, our students achieve beyond their language capabilities. They are cross-cultural learners who celebrate diversity.
