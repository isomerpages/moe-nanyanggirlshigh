As an established SAP school, we take pride in providing all our students a conducive bilingual bicultural environment.

In our school, students are given a strong foundation for understanding the East and the West and achieving mastery in both the English and the Chinese languages. Our comprehensive curriculum integrates authentic learning experiences, such as cultural immersion programmes, overseas exchange trips, and collaborative projects with partner schools in China, South-east Asia and other English-speaking countries. These experiences allow students to practice their language skills in real-world contexts and gain a deeper appreciation of different cultures.

Our students may or may not have taken Higher Chinese in Primary School. With a passion for language and the right attitude for learning, our students are well guided in their bilingual bicultural journey as learners. Through our non-academic programmes, such as cultural festivals celebrations, bilingual current affairs quizzes, cultural appreciation workshops and out of the classroom learning journeys, students are exposed to a variety of perspectives and traditions, enhancing their cross-cultural understanding. These activities not only reinforce their language proficiency but also foster a sense of cultural appreciation.

At the end of their secondary school life with us, our students achieve beyond their language capabilities. They are cross-cultural learners who celebrate diversity and are equipped with the skills and mindset needed to navigate and contribute to a multicultural world. Whether they are participating in a traditional Chinese calligraphy workshop or leading a discussion in a Model United Nations conference, our students demonstrate their ability to bridge cultures and communicate effectively in both English and Chinese.
