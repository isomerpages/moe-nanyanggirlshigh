Character and Leadership Development is an integral part of the school’s Student Development curriculum which emphasises the importance of holistic development in the five domains: Moral 德, Intellectual 智, Physical 体, Social 群and Aesthetics 美 (五育). Character and Leadership Development comprises Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) and Student Leadership Development. 

The school aims to nurture all students to be role models and servant leaders, who are confident to lead by example and remain resilient in the face of challenges and changes. Through lesson discussions, on-the-job experiences and mentoring by teachers and seniors, students are developed to become caring and empathetic leaders who are capable of making informed choices, with a clear sense of purpose.
