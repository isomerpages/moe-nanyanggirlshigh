The school aims to nurture all students to be role models and servant leaders with a clear sense of purpose and agency. When faced with challenges, they remain resilient and are confident in leading others.

We adopt the **Discover – Develop – Shine** approach in Student Leadership Development. This approach focuses on students **discovering** for themselves an understanding of self-leadership through class-level and cohort-level experiences. Through on-the-job experiences, workshops, seminars, camps, service-learning projects, cross-cultural learning, self-reflection and mentoring by teachers and seniors, students further **develop** their leadership knowledge, skills and values, and **shine** as they apply what they have learned as student leaders.

In their four years in Nanyang, all students would have gone through leadership-development experiences such as Values Education and Strengths Finder Assessment, Classroom Role Selections, CCE Lessons on Self-Discovery and Leadership and Sharing by Invited Speakers. 

Opportunities to lead in classroom roles, CCAs and group projects such as ComEd-SPICE or Life Skills Programme (LSP) segments are made available to all students.
