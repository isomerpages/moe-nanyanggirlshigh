The Counselling Programme is helmed by the Student Support Team, with members including full-time school counsellors, a student learning coach and a student befriender. Counselling is a collaborative process in which the counsellor helps the students to broaden their perspectives, expand their repertoire of coping resources and enable them to make choices without destructive consequences to self or others. The goal of intervention is to help students manage their problems effectively as part of their emotional and social development.

Working closely with the Student Support Team are our Student Positivity Champions (peer supporter). 

By teaching our Positivity Champions the knowledge, skills, and attitude of a peer supporter, we can shape them into effective agents of change. By having these Positivity Champions present within each class and amongst the student body, we aim to create a supportive climate in school where students feel the empathy, and kindness from their peers. Cultivating a “pay it forward” culture, positivity and kindness will radiate outwards, eventually reaching the entire student body. We hope to create a culture of kindness, empathy, and compassion.
