With global connectivity and the pervasive use of information and communication tools being an integral part of our daily lives, the school recognises the pertinent need to equip students with the necessary skills and knowledge to help create empowered and empathetic digital citizens who can deal with important issues at the confluence of classroom learning, technology and society. These aspects include identifying and evaluating possible online risks and taking actions to be a positive online influence for the community.

Our Cyber Wellness and Digital Citizenship framework is incorporated in CCE curriculum time and through programmes such as workshops, talks and activities. These are led by teachers and Technology & Cyberwellness Ambassadors, who are peer-elected class student leaders.
