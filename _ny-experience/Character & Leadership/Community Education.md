## Community Education - Serving People with Innovation, Creativity and Enterprise (ComEd-SPICE)

All Nanyang girls go through a four-year Community Education Programme (ComEd) which incorporates service-learning, experiential learning and leadership development to equip our students with the knowledge, skills, values and attitudes to respectfully engage and meaningfully serve the community. 

The programme is carried out in a scaffolded manner that progresses from Exploration to Inquiry to Agency through a host of projects that emphasises leadership, cross-cultural learning, and initiative:

##### Secondary 1 & 2
At the lower secondary level, students go through the ComEd-SPICE programme. Versed in the design thinking framework, they put these skills to use in their service to and with community partners as a class.
 
##### Secondary 3 & 4
Through the Sec 3 Service-Learning Projects and the Sec 4 Independent Service-Learning Projects, the upper secondary students are given the autonomy and time to explore suitable Voluntary Welfare Organisations they are interested in working with and work in groups to carry out a project with a community of their choice. Teachers act as mentors to facilitate the learning process and guide students through their research, planning and reflections over their service and learning journey. Students may also return as alumni to mentor their juniors on projects that they have worked on to ensure continuation.
