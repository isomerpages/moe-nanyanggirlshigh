In NYGH, we aim to develop every Nanyang girl into **a Woman of Character, an Empowered Learner and an Agent of Change**, guided by our school values - 勤 (Diligence), 慎 (Prudence), 端 (Respectability), 朴 (Simplicity).


#### Positive Education

The student experience is undergirded by  Positive Education Principles across THREE POWER DOMAINS: **Power of Me, Power of Community, Power of Yet**.

The three Power Domains nurture our students into flourishing and reflective lifelong learners. They form the common language cutting across both the Academia and Student Development experiences.

**Power of Me** focuses on a student’s values, identity and motivation to grow, live well and find meaning and fulfillment in her life.

The ways to do so include:
* Building on Character Strengths
* Developing a Growth Mindset
* Developing Mindfulness
* Setting SMART goals


**Power of Community** builds a culture of empathy and gratitude, as strong and positive relationships are forged. Having a genuine regard for the community allows a student to appreciate the strengths of others and find support from the people around her. She will also gain a sense of fulfillment when she contributes to the community.


**Power of Yet** values reflection in the journey of lifelong learning. Through reflection, a student gains a deeper understanding of the meaning, purpose and application of her learning and cherishes the opportunities to seek improvements and contribute further.

The NYGH Co-Curriculum (NY PLus) provides students with the opportunities to develop the three power domains through: 
* Enrichment activities and talks
* Character and Citizenship Education (CCE)
* Induction Programme
* Life Skills Programme (LSP)
* Community Education - Serving People with Innovation, Commitment and Empathy (ComEd-SPICE)
* Global Classroom Programme (GCP)
* Preparation for Nanyang Honour Roll (NYHR)
