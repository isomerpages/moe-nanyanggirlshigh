### **Strategic Educational Alliance of Southeast Asia**

<p>With globalisation and advancement in technology, schools need to nurture students who can work in teams, acquire knowledge and form global connections through enhanced networked activities and global virtual communities. There is therefore a need to work towards greater synergy, to create a 21st Century learning environment for 21st Century learners.</p>
<p>Nanyang Girls’ High School (NYGH) firmly believes that the future advancement of education to a new level of excellence is through the collaborative efforts of global education leaders. It was with this in mind that she initiated the formation of the Strategic Alliance of Global Educators (SAGE) in 2012.</p>
<p>SAGE unites top forward looking and innovative schools from around the world with the aim of bringing educators together to form professional networks that allow wider and deeper sharing of pedagogical ideas, resources and best practices. Founding members include Nanyang Girls’ High School (Singapore), High School Affiliated to Fudan University (Shanghai, China), High School Affiliated to Peking University (Beijing, China), High School Affiliated to Renmin University Xishan (Beijing, China), Shanghai No. 3 Girls’ High School (Shanghai, China), Hwa Chong Institution (Singapore), Menlo School (California, USA), School of Science and Technology, Singapore&nbsp;(Singapore), Scotch College Melbourne (Australia) and The Perse School (Cambridge, UK).</p>
<p>SAGE is also most privileged to have with us the East Asian Institute as our Conference Sharing Partner.</p>
