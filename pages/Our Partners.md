### **Nanyang Kindergarten**
<p>Nanyang Kindergarten was founded in July 1934. At that time, it was affiliated to Nanyang Girls’ High School. Nanyang Kindergarten is believed to have been the first Chinese kindergarten in the whole of the Malayan Peninsula at that time. The school premises were used as a field office by the British Army during the Second World War, and its facilities were subsequently destroyed during the Japanese Occupation of Singapore. After the war, with the concerted and dedicated efforts of the Board of Directors, management, staff and alumni, the School was slowly restored to its former glory. Nanyang Kindergarten grew and evolved into an independent entity of its own in 1960, marked by its historic move into 118 King’s Road in the same year.</p>
<p>It was the vision of our wise predecessors to provide quality education for students from kindergarten through to high school. Nanyang Kindergarten shares the same rich heritage of the Nanyang Family which comprises Nanyang Kindergarten, Nanyang Primary School and Nanyang Girls’ High School. Nanyang Kindergarten has a well­ established tradition and owes its present achievements to the hard work and dedication of the Board of Directors, management, staff, alumni and community leaders over the years.</p>

### **Nanyang Schools Alumni Association**
<p>The NSAA was established by a group of enthusiastic alumni in 1945 with a mission to give back to the alma mater, unite the alumni and support the development of the schools.</p>
<p>To resume the education of children who were forced to stop schooling during the Second World War, the NSAA led fundraising efforts to rebuild Nanyang quickly, and helped to restore school operations by locating teaching staff and former students, all of which were arduous tasks back in war torn Singapore.</p>
<p>In 1952, alumni associations were dissolved by the colonial government. Although there was no formal alumni association, the alumni remained dedicated to Nanyang, and actively participated and contributed to the development of the school buildings.</p>
<p>The NSAA was re-established in 1984 when the restrictions on alumni associations were lifted. It led fundraising efforts to help build new campuses with world class facilities to provide an ideal learning environment for students.</p>
<p>Resources were also dedicated to supporting our retired staff through visits and funds, contributing to the community through volunteer services, and providing alumni with opportunities to reconnect with the schools and broaden their network through activities and educational talks.</p>
<p>At NSAA, we recognise that a school’s development is closely related to the strength of its alumni. For over 100 years, Nanyang was able to overcome various challenges and adversity because of the immense support from our alumni.</p>
<p>Today, the NSAA continues to work closely with the Nanyang Family of Schools and serves as the bridge of connection between Nanyang and her alumni.</p>
