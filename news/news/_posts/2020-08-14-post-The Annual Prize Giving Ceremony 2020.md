The Annual Prize Giving ceremony is a milestone event for us to celebrate the efforts, achievements, and journeys of our Nanyang students across various domains. We have taken the ceremony online this year, capturing the stories of the prize recipients and their personal messages of gratitude on a digital platform. This year's Annual Prize Giving is also held in conjunction with the celebration of the school's 103rd Founder's Day.

Our Annual Prize Giving 2020 micro-site is now live at&nbsp;[SITES.GOOGLE.COM/NYGH.EDU.SG/APG2020](https://sites.google.com/nygh.edu.sg/apg2020).
