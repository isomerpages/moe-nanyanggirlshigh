If you would like to find out more about what secondary life culture is like, then visit us at our Open House on Saturday, 15 April, from 8am to 2pm.

You are warmly invited to visit our Curriculum and CCA showcases and enjoy performances by our Performing Arts CCAs. Attend the various school talks and live Q and A sessions where you will get to meet the Principal and Vice Principals. Sign up for an exciting school tour to explore our campus. You will have opportunities to interact with the students to understand what it means to be a Nanyang Girl. So visit us to learn about our holistic programmes which we offer to nurture our students into women of character, empowered learners, and agents of change.

We look forward to seeing you at our Open House on Saturday, 15 April!

Please take public transport. There will be no parking provided.
